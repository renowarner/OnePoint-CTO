**OnePoint CTO** ("Company"),
**AND**
**__________________________** ("Counterparty").

The Company and the Counterparty may be referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

**WHEREAS**, the Parties wish to explore a potential business relationship (the "Purpose"); and
**WHEREAS**, in connection with the Purpose, each Party (the "Disclosing Party") may disclose to the other Party (the "Receiving Party") certain confidential and proprietary technical and business information;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

### 1. Definition of Confidential Information
"Confidential Information" means all non-public, proprietary, or confidential information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether orally, in writing, or in electronic format, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to:
*   **Technical Data:** Source code, algorithms, APIs, software architecture, system credentials, security protocols, and development roadmaps.
*   **Business Data:** Customer lists, financial records, pricing structures, marketing strategies, and internal workflows.
*   **Intellectual Property:** Methods, processes, inventions, know-how, and trade secrets.

### 2. Obligations of Confidentiality
The Receiving Party agrees to:
*   **Strict Confidence:** Hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.
*   **Limited Use:** Use the Confidential Information solely for the Purpose of evaluating or pursuing the business relationship.
*   **Standard of Care:** Protect the Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.
*   **Need-to-Know:** Restrict access to the Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, and agents who have a specific need to know such information for the Purpose and who are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.

### 3. Exclusions
The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to any information that:
*   Is or becomes generally available to the public through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.
*   Was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality.
*   Is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure.
*   Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.

### 4. Compelled Disclosure
If the Receiving Party is compelled by law, court order, or regulation to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice (to the extent legally permitted) to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If disclosure is required, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required.

### 5. Return or Destruction of Materials
Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party or the termination of the business relationship, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents, files, and other materials containing Confidential Information, including all copies and derivatives thereof.

### 6. Term
This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of **two (2) years** from the Effective Date. The obligations of confidentiality with respect to any trade secrets shall survive indefinitely so long as such information remains a trade secret under applicable law.

### 7. No License or Warranty
Nothing in this Agreement grants any license or right to the Receiving Party regarding the Confidential Information or any intellectual property rights. All Confidential Information is provided "AS IS," without any warranty, express or implied, regarding its accuracy or completeness.
