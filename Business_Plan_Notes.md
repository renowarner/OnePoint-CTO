# Business Plan Notes
**Date Started:** 2026-02-11
**Project Goal:** Establish a profitable small business with a stable baseline income.

## Current Progress: Phase 1 - Business Concept
**Mission:** Provide a "one-stop shop" virtual CTO service for small businesses, focusing on automation, AI implementation, cost reduction, and systems management (websites, bots, lead capture, marketing, SEO) to deliver high-level technical leadership remotely and affordably.

## Service Menu
1. **Consultation & Audit:** A uniform deep-dive audit of current business systems and technical needs.
2. **V-CTO Retainer:** Ongoing systems management, maintenance, and technical leadership.
3. **Growth Package:** Basic Marketing, SEO, and Lead Generation setup and management.

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
**Integration & Efficiency:** In an age of connection, hiring separate experts leads to fragmented systems, tripled expenses, and communication overhead. This service offers a single point of contact and synchronized systems, reducing costs and complexity while eliminating the "three experts, three bills, three problems" headache.

## Financial Goals
- **Short-term Baseline:** $45,000 / year ($3,750 / month)
- **Long-term Goal:** $75,000 / year ($6,250 / month)

## Phase 2: Business Formation & Tax Readiness (Scheduled)
