Summary
Tyler Hamilton and R discussed the necessary rebranding of Northwest Roof and Solar Care, formerly Pure Water Solar Cleaning, including updating the website, logo, and company name to reflect the broadened services now including roof repair. R advised Tyler Hamilton on SEO, using a CRM system for recurring business and client management, and improving the website content with accurate metrics, professional photos, and social media links. R confirmed the website's lack of SEO presence and offered a trademark law firm referral, while both agreed on the importance of professional branding, which contrasts with the partner's "simplistic" view, and R suggested strategies like Google Ads and local marketing, proposing a follow-up call with Tyler Hamilton's partner, Kevin, to discuss the budget and next steps.


Details
* Company Overview and Background Tyler Hamilton is taking a day off after a difficult job removing 4 inches of water and debris from a flat roof (00:00:00). Tyler Hamilton’s business primarily focuses on solar cleaning, roof cleaning, and roof repair, operating as an LLC split 50/50 with their partner, who started the company but lacked roofing experience (00:01:26). The company, originally named Pure Water Solar Cleaning, is changing its name to Northwest Roof and Solar Care to better fit its broadened services, which now include roof repairs after obtaining a General Contractor (GC) license (00:02:25).
* Branding and Website Strategy R and Tyler Hamilton discussed the company's branding and website, purewatersolar.com (00:03:35). R confirmed that the existing website is a good template and suggested keeping and modifying it, including changing the name and logo to reflect the new company name, Northwest Roof and Solar Care (00:05:30). Tyler Hamilton explained that the name change is crucial so customers seeking roofing repair are not confused by the old solar cleaning name. Tyler Hamilton also mentioned that they hired a lead flow generator for $1,500 per month and are waiting on lead flow (00:04:33).
* Logo and Trademarking Tyler Hamilton shared that they used AI to create the new company logo, which they confirmed is unique and unused by anyone else. R inquired about trademarking, explaining that registering an LLC does not provide a claim over the name and that another company with a trademark could legally take action (00:07:55). Tyler Hamilton confirmed the name is not yet trademarked but that their partner is looking into opening the new name as a DBA (doing business as) for easier tax purposes. R offered to provide a referral to a patent and trademark law firm (00:09:27).
* SEO and Website Traffic R conducted a quick analysis of the existing website, purewatersolar.com, and determined that it has "no SEO hit," meaning it does not appear in relevant Google searches, like "King County solar cleaning". R highlighted that the difference between no SEO and a tiny bit is huge (00:13:11). R clarified their role as performing virtual CTO work, managing tech systems, including CRM, job tracking, and SEO, while recommending Google Ads as a marketing option despite its cost (00:11:52).
* Business Activity and Lead Generation Tyler Hamilton reported that the company just launched last summer, completed about 10 jobs to fine-tune equipment and the sales process, and paused operations during the winter (00:14:35). Tyler Hamilton expects to start receiving leads soon, as a campaign with the new lead generator began today. R proposed creating a Google Form questionnaire to gather necessary business information before their next meeting (00:15:42).
* Client Management and Marketing Campaigns R emphasized the benefit of a CRM email system for recurring business, such as solar cleaning, which Tyler Hamilton estimates should be done quarterly in Washington due to pollen and winter debris. A CRM system could automate quarterly email reminders to maintenance clients, increasing recurring service revenue, especially since the company already offered bulk subscription discounts (00:16:39). R suggested that the CRM could also track client purchasing behavior and automate timed, discounted offers for clients who delay cleaning, leveraging sales tactics like raising the price before applying a percentage discount (00:18:47).
* Website Content and Metrics R advised Tyler Hamilton on humanizing the website by including nice headshots and names, especially for a personal state like Washington, to make clients more comfortable (00:19:52). R also pointed out that the website template includes false metrics, such as "38+ qualified cleaners" and "450 customers," which can create unrealistic client expectations and availability issues (00:21:08). R also mentioned that the social media links on the website template, such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, do not currently link to anything (00:22:19).
* Marketing Philosophy and Partner Alignment Tyler Hamilton expressed that they value the importance of a professional website, branding, and advertising, contrasting with their partner's "simplistic" view that companies can succeed with just "white vans" (00:23:25). R supported Tyler Hamilton's view, noting that a wrapped van serves as an important billboard during jobs and gives a professional appearance, unlike a "white windowless van" (00:24:29). R shared a technique for overcoming a partner's resistance to change by making isolated, positive changes and then showing the financial results (00:25:25). R cited a law firm client's data, showing that only 48 out of 497 recent leads were from Google, emphasizing the importance of Google search optimization, and called door hangers the "equivalent of a booer" (00:28:39).
* Google Page and Marketing Tactics Tyler Hamilton asked if a physical address is required for a Google Business Profile, as their operation is mobile. R confirmed that they can use a PO box or set it up to show only service areas (00:30:16). R suggested using the Google and Yelp pages for customer reviews, proposing discounts for five-star reviews or referrals. R also proposed marketing to HOA developments to secure deals, which could result in 19 houses being required to use their service (00:31:10). R also suggested a strategy to get the partner to understand the value of online presence by asking them to find three examples of successful companies with only white vans, forcing them to use Google and proving the point themselves (00:33:08).
* Targeted Marketing and Next Steps R stressed the importance of marketing to the local area, suggesting that including a headshot and gender-neutral pronouns like "he/him" on the website would appeal to consumers in Washington (00:34:08). Tyler Hamilton agreed that this would appeal to the local demographic (00:34:51). R asked about Tyler Hamilton's target monthly budget for things like Google ad spend and system monthly costs. Tyler Hamilton said they would need to get back to R with that information, and R concluded the meeting by agreeing to set up a follow-up call with Tyler Hamilton's partner, Kevin, to discuss the budget and next steps (00:35:37).


Suggested next steps
* Tyler Hamilton will ask his partner for the current website's hosting information and send it to R.
* R will provide Tyler Hamilton a referral to a patent and trademark law firm at a referral rate.
* R will put together a Google form questionnaire for Tyler Hamilton's company and share it.
* Tyler Hamilton will determine the budget for a monthly cost and a marketing campaign and get back to R.
* Tyler Hamilton will set up another Google Meet and include Kevin for the next discussion.
