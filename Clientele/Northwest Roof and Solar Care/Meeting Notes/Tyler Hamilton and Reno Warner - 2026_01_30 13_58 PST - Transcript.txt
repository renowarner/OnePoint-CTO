Tyler Hamilton: I got paid pretty good, so I didn't need to necessarily go in today. f****** there was I was working on this flat roof and there was like 4 in of water on top of it and I had to like get all the water off and then there was a bunch of debris clogging all the down spouts I had to get cleared out. So,
R: Oh,
Tyler Hamilton: that's that was a fun one.

Tyler Hamilton: They just don't drink. They don't drain
R: So it's yeah they're they're the roofs are
Tyler Hamilton: well.
R: sloped for a reason.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
R: So is that pretty much uh what the main thing you do is like like uh roof
Tyler Hamilton: Um,
R: cleaning.
Tyler Hamilton: so I'm I primarily do solar cleaning, roof cleaning, and and roofing
R: Okay.
Tyler Hamilton: repair.
R: Okay. And uh I know one thing you mentioned is you do have the LLC.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Yeah. So, it's it's me and my partner. He's kind of he kind of had this s*** going a little bit before I joined. He just didn't have a lot of the roofing experience.
R: All
Tyler Hamilton: And so, um, I was perfect fit for being the production side of things, but we do split 50/50 over the company.
R: right, that's good.
 
 
00:02:25
 
R: That's
Tyler Hamilton: And so,
R: good.
Tyler Hamilton: and so some information I may not have handy right at the moment, but I mean, primarily what we what we're focusing towards is roof cleaning,
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: roof repair, and solar cleaning. We have a website built out for the solar cleaning. Um, it wasn't until recently where I was like, let yo, let's get the GC so I can handle roof repairs as well because that can be a good source of income for the company as well. Um, the company was originally named Pure Water Solar Cleaning. Um, and we are deciding to change it to Northwest Roof and Solar Care just cuz it's a little bit more fitting for um, what we're trying to do and who who we're trying
R: Yeah. Oh,
Tyler Hamilton: to
R: North I will say Northwest is is the the good one. A lot of people use evergreen uh because we're the evergreen state and unfortunately a lot of people
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: in the same fields use evergreen. There are like 14 evergreen uh construction that all are named evergreen construction and it's just it's a nightmare for
 
 
00:03:35
 
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, I tried ever I I Oh my god.
R: them.
Tyler Hamilton: I tried going for evergreen, but I just didn't like the way it looked. I mean, it looked like a hospital
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: logo.
R: Yeah. Um, and so I was saying, so what what's the uh what is the website for the solar side of
Tyler Hamilton: It's called purewater solar solar.com.
R: things?
Tyler Hamilton: You could look it up right now if you want. purewatersolar.com.
R: Okay. All right. Oh, this a pretty standard uh pretty standard good site.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah,
R: Um,
Tyler Hamilton: I think we paid like a,000 bucks for that thing.
R: that's not bad.
Tyler Hamilton: It's crazy.
R: That that's that's not
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. So,
R: bad.
Tyler Hamilton: I mean I initially I want to if we could utilize that same website just change it the name on it and like the logo and stuff that'd be f****** sweet without having to drop that much money.
R: Uh,
Tyler Hamilton: We're I'm waiting on I'm wait I'm waiting on lead flow right now.
 
 
00:04:33
 
R: do you know
Tyler Hamilton: I we just hired a lead flow generator for like 1,500 bucks a month. He's going to supply us with leads and stuff. Um, and I what I wanted to do is focus on getting the name changed so that way when these people contact us, they don't see a solar cleaning company like, "Oh, these guys are going to do my roofing repair. What the hell?" You know, I don't want them to confuse them, you know?
R: Yeah. Um, do you know where this p where this page is
Tyler Hamilton: But
R: hosted?
Tyler Hamilton: that I'm not sure. I just got off the phone with my partner and he said uh that he he had he had a person do it for him. And so, um, yeah. So, I could I can find that definitely find that out for you here. Let me text him right now. See if I can get that answer while we're in the
R: cuz uh just looking at it,
Tyler Hamilton: call.
R: I mean it's I mean it's definitely it's a template for sure.
 
 
00:05:30
 
R: Um but it's one of the good templates.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: Um so updating it would be wouldn't be too hard. Um, and just basically I would say with this is I mean keep this and then just modify it, swap it out and then get a new uh set up the new uh domain and admin stuff for it and just rebrand basically and you can connect this.
Tyler Hamilton: He thinks it's called Blue Host or something like
R: Oh yeah, Blue Host.
Tyler Hamilton: that.
R: Blue Host is a common one. Um yeah, so if you have access to it,
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: um getting it's pretty easy to kind of work with this um and just changing out the logo,
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: changing out the domain and everything.
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: Let's see.
Tyler Hamilton: I'm
R: Yeah,
Tyler Hamilton: listening.
R: I'm just kind of going over it and seeing what they uh our work process. This is
Tyler Hamilton: I think it be could be cleaned up a in a little bit. I'm I I I like it, but I don't at the same time.
 
 
00:06:37
 
Tyler Hamilton: I feel like there's a lot to look at.
R: Yeah, it's it's it's a lot to look at. Um, what is the request estimate? So, the request estimate that's pretty solid like Yeah. Yeah. No, I think I think this is I think this is a uh a really good foundation to start on. I would I would definitely focus on just getting this switched over.
Tyler Hamilton: right?
R: Um,
Tyler Hamilton: Is there a way I can attach um a photo in here?
R: uh, yeah, you should be able to, um, there's just just a chat.
Tyler Hamilton: Where is that chat at? Obviously, I'm not the most techsavvy.
R: I just sent a message in the chat, so it should pop up.
Tyler Hamilton: Okay, cool. Cool. Now, we're going to go here. How do I share photos? I want to see your message. Um, it's not giving me an option to pop a photo in.
R: Um, if you want, uh, you want, you could just email it to me,
Tyler Hamilton: Okay, I'll do that right
 
 
00:07:55
 
R: yeah, that's easy enough.
Tyler Hamilton: now.
R: Um,
Tyler Hamilton: Makes it easier. We already check We already checked the uh the I'm sending this photo. Sorry.
R: Oh, you're good.
Tyler Hamilton: And so I used AI to make it so that way we can put it on any background, company name. Okay. I just sent that over to
R: All
Tyler Hamilton: you.
R: right.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. So, I just sent that over here. That's going to be the new logo. I already checked everything to make sure that it was um solid and can be used and no one else has it. So, it's that's
R: Yeah. Um yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: all.
R: Uh so do you have any sort of any trademarking?
Tyler Hamilton: What does that mean?
R: Uh so trademarking is when you when you form an LLC, you register the business, but it doesn't have any sort of claim over the actual name. Um, so is uh if you if you have if you so you've got Northwest Roof and Solar Care um if there is another company out there with the same business name and they have a tra they have a trademark,
 
 
00:09:27
 
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: they can legally shut you down or take or like sue you
Tyler Hamilton: Oh, I see what you're saying.
R: and stuff like that.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. So,
R: Uh yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: nobody has the name, but it isn't trademarked yet. This is all just stuff that we're going to start that we're working on getting changed over right now.
R: Yeah,
Tyler Hamilton: And
R: I I I work with a patent and trademark law firm uh as one of my client clients and
Tyler Hamilton: so
R: so I I could probably get you a like a referral
Tyler Hamilton: Oh, okay. That'd be sick. Yeah.
R: rate.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. So, B, yeah, we're working on getting that switched over. He's talking to his an account, his accountant right now. I think he's going to open it as a DBA. I think that's what it's called. Yeah.
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: like bas bas essentially like for tax purposes it'll still be pure water just because it's a lot easier than contacting the IRS and then doing all of these steps you know we can just take the name of Northwest Roof and Solar Care um and that'll be what the customer sees.
 
 
00:10:26
 
Tyler Hamilton: Does that make sense?
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: It's called like a DBA.
R: Yeah. Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: Sorry.
R: Doing it's a DBA is doing business as Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Yeah.
R: So with a DBA um do you do you have you done anything with SEO at all? Yeah. like uh what your web presence,
Tyler Hamilton: SEO.
R: search engine optimization, you know, right now is like where how where are people coming to your site? How do you have people going to
Tyler Hamilton: Oh, yeah.
R: it?
Tyler Hamilton: I don't I'm not I'm not too sure. Let me see if I can get my Are we Can we invite anybody in here?
R: Yeah, absolutely.
Tyler Hamilton: And how do I do
R: Uh let's see.
Tyler Hamilton: that?
R: If you're at at the top, you're on mobile. Um, uh, if you want to give me, uh, just give me the email, I can add them real quick because I know it's different on
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: mobile.
Tyler Hamilton: Um, I just sent him a text for his email.
 
 
00:11:52
 
Tyler Hamilton: Let me see if I can't figure out how to add him because I'm not the host, so I might not be able to add him.
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: tools. No, that ain't going to work. Yeah, I'll just get his email and then we can have him pop in because these these are the answers that he has mainly. I was just kind of wondering like do you primarily set up websites and then do marketing and stuff? Like what do you what's your I didn't I didn't really get a clear view that night.
R: Uh, so yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: We were
R: Um, so I do system like virtual CTO work.
Tyler Hamilton: drinking.
R: Um, and so I manage pretty much everything tech-wise, system, CRM, how you're tracking your clients, how you're tracking your your uh your jobs, you know,
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: uh any I uh I can do SEO as well. It's not too red. Um, but I what marketing I do is usually based off of um I mean Google ads are easy enough. Um, and that's probably the way I would suggest, but it's also it's pricey.
 
 
00:13:11
 
R: It's pricey until you have the the right revenue for it.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Right.
R: Um but um because right now from what I'm seeing on the pure solar is it's got like no SEO hit. So you're like you're is a solar cleaning company and you list that you work in King County. A Google search for King County solar cleaning doesn't even show you up.
Tyler Hamilton: Oh, I see. So that's a
R: Yeah. So that's that's the that's the main thing with SEO.
Tyler Hamilton: problem.
R: And the difference between no SEO and like a teeny bit is huge. Um, and I'm taking a look at the I'm looking at uh traffic. I want to get a traffic report on
Tyler Hamilton: the
R: Yeah,
Tyler Hamilton: website.
R: let's see. I'll do Spyu.
Tyler Hamilton: Settle down, boys. What's
R: But yeah, so with the market, so I could do a little bit of marketing and advertising in that that realm. Um what I mostly do is like man fully managing like internal systems building out the admin like email like emails SSLs on any any sites site hosting uh CRM management and through
 
 
00:14:35
 
Tyler Hamilton: up?
R: CRM management then I uh marketing campaigns by email um you know I can gen set up and generate a newsletter so it just keeps
Tyler Hamilton: Hey.
R: people aware of you.
Tyler Hamilton: Okay. Sorry about that. I got freaking two two-year-olds running around my
R: Oh, that's Oh,
Tyler Hamilton: dogs.
R: it's it's worse. It's worse than child.
Tyler Hamilton: Oh,
R: Oh,
Tyler Hamilton: yeah.
R: the puppy energy. Uh,
Tyler Hamilton: They just randomly want to f*** s*** up.
R: yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: That would
R: From what I can what I can tell, there's no SEO on that.
Tyler Hamilton: do.
R: Um, so that's that's definitely a thing that can that can be done. Um, how many clients would do you say you uh service in in like a month?
Tyler Hamilton: So, we just launched last summer and we maybe did like 10 jobs just trying to fine-tune the equipment we were using. um and just kind of get used to like what it was like, you know, um with the sales process and everything.
 
 
00:15:42
 
Tyler Hamilton: And so we put a halt on it like at the end of the at the end of the summer coming into winter cuz stuff started, you know, slowing down. We didn't know what the weather was going to be like. So we kind of put a halt on that. We both had like full-time jobs on the side, you know, and so we're just kicking it kicking it back into gear.
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: So I don't really know that information. And I know that I'll know pretty soon here with this lead generator. We just launched our campaign today, so I should start receiving texts and and calls with
R: Hell yeah. That's awesome. Um,
Tyler Hamilton: leads.
R: but and honestly like there's a lot of like random little things like that we would want to know and I think I mentioned it uh when I when we met. But uh what I'll most likely do is just put together like a whole Google form questionnaire um that and
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: then that way you can kind of jot down the information and see everything as you need it and then when you have it all we'll be able to go over it together.
 
 
00:16:39
 
R: Uh uh let's see. Uh how how often is it suggested to clean solar
Tyler Hamilton: Um I would say quarterly in Washington just because um in the springtime you know
R: panels?
Tyler Hamilton: moss tends to not moss but the you know right after springtime you got all the uh pollen that floats around and then the sun bakes it onto the solar. So definitely after spring and after winter come a little bit of
R: Okay. So yeah. So then uh then having a CRM email system is probably going to be really good for
Tyler Hamilton: spring
R: you. You know, being able to ba basically reviving leads and keeping them as maintenance clients. Uh so you collect enough information with it and you get everything in, you build it, you can track, you can then track all of your sales and everything and see see how people are invoicing and all of
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: that. Um, but more importantly, then you can have a system that automatically emails them quarterly to remind them. So, they're getting every single person you work with that gets into opted into your system is getting pitched on a solar cleaning every quarter.
 
 
00:18:01
 
Tyler Hamilton: Okay, I see what you're
R: So,
Tyler Hamilton: saying,
R: like passive uh when when it comes to stuff like that, it's really nice because it's it's a it's a recurring service that you can do.
Tyler Hamilton: right? Yeah. So, what we what we were doing Hey, stop it.
R: Um,
Tyler Hamilton: We we were doing uh like basically a subscription where you know our first your first cleaning if you only wanted wanted the one it would be more expensive than it would be to get a like or so like overtime as bulk. So like you're buying in bulk you know like if you bought bulk it's cheaper than so we would do quarterly for bulk for
R: yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: a bulk discount price and then that it would make more sense for them to get quarterly just because it's recommended for quarterly.
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: Some people penny pinchers out here,
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: you
R: Yeah. And Yeah. And then like the nice thing with with that is you can track whether or not they bought it because if they
 
 
00:18:47
 
Tyler Hamilton: know.
R: if they do are on a quarterly thing, they can just be tagged as on the quarterly thing and they don't need to be getting the quarterly reminder. So you can make sure everybody gets the exact thing they need.
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: Um and then you can also do things where you know if people do it you know if they they haven't done it for a quarter after and it's let's say it's you know been like two months or like after a month and a half after they should have done it you they can automatically get a hey look um I know we recommend this is quarterly but we want to make sure you're taken care of so like we want to give you like 15% off a cleaning and then you can pitch to people who are penny pinching and get them disc get them, you know, marginal discounts and do always do the retail thing of like,
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: yeah, so we're going to dis discount it by the percentage that we're going to increase it before we discount it.
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: If you want to give them a 50% off,
 
 
00:19:52
 
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. So,
R: double the price
Tyler Hamilton: so yeah.
R: first.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, I know. That's smart. Do you think so? So do you do you like design websites?
R: Yeah, I've I've built websites. Um I have no eye for art and appeal.
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: Um so I'm critical with templates, but like um like I launched I launched my site and that was just one thing of something I slapped together recently and it's just basicformational.
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: Um,
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: I man I manage and work on like pitch sites like
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: um like one of the one of the the law firms I I work for is funny is it's almost identical. It is that like moving moving banner at the top of the at the top where you land and then you know an about us services.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: Um let's see about us thing. Um, I would say Washington is a pretty like intimate state. Um, so like on the about us, um, I would honestly get like some really great head shot of like, uh, you guys and like put your picture at who we are.
 
 
00:21:08
 
R: Um, people like seeing seeing a face of the people that are going to be around their house.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah,
R: Uh,
Tyler Hamilton: 100%. That's a good
R: humanizing it.
Tyler Hamilton: point.
R: Um uh the I I'll say the uh the uh the false metrics seem a little out of out of sense. Like on the about us page, it's uh 38 plus qualified cleaners, 450 C customers, and 5K projects completed is makes you seem like a like a near national company.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, that's what it says on our website.
R: Um yeah yeah yeah
Tyler Hamilton: Oh s***. See,
R: yeah 38 plus qualified cleaners.
Tyler Hamilton: I I didn't put this I didn't put this together.
R: Uh so uh
Tyler Hamilton: And it's just And it's just me.
R: yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: That's
R: Yes. And so with that with that that like that sets and then there's right next to a free request free estimate that
Tyler Hamilton: hilarious.
R: sets an availability thing that you know sets you up for a like a client getting disappointed when it's like well if you have 30 cleaners why do I have to wait a week?
 
 
00:22:19
 
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, that's valid.
R: Yeah. And it's all about barrier to entry is making it as low as possible.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. No, for
R: Um I like the template that the person used for this. Um it's pretty cool.
Tyler Hamilton: sure.
R: It's but it's it's definitely a template cuz uh you know we've got the uh Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter thing uh links on here. Um they they don't go to anything. they just they just go to Facebook. Um uh social media like presence and stuff like that. That's something for sure that uh I can do that ties in.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: So like one thing oh like marketing wise I think what I could do is I could find some lead
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: generation sources like I was talking about with the island um and I can figure out ways to kind of do approach that. Um, with like lead genen campaigns, I usually uh do those by like individual. It's just like propose it and its cost and you know we'll try it like and run things as campaigns.
 
 
00:23:25
 
R: But I can I can build I I can get everything like I can get the YouTube uh
Tyler Hamilton: Red.
R: up, the Instagram, Facebook if you need and then just get things posting to it and then l literally can get you a like a homework sheet of like, hey, here's a checklist. take like this kind of p photo and this kind of thing and if you like
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, I like that.
R: like just five minutes of of photos every every job you do and then just dump it into a Google Drive and then post it once trickle post it once a
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: week. Keeps it active, keeps it on there.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. That's smart.
R: Um
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. So, this is this is how I this is how I think, you know, I think a website's important. I think, you know, getting our band wrapped and like um dialing in all of these things cuz I think all of that stuff's super important. like the advice you're giving me I'm I value a lot because my partner on the other hand thinks that like oh we can there's people that make millions of dollars a year just with the white veins and I'm like he's more
 
 
00:24:29
 
R: Yeah. AB.
Tyler Hamilton: he's a lot more simplistic about it but I want to like grow grow this s*** you
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: know
R: People can absolutely people that can absolutely make a million dollars a year with a white man. Who?
Tyler Hamilton: yeah who yeah
R: That's the first question I'm going to ask. Who can? What What What's their name?
Tyler Hamilton: where Yeah.
R: If it were on the van, you'd know.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Yeah. That's
R: Uh it's it's recognition and but you don't need to wrap the I was wrapping your first
Tyler Hamilton: valid.
R: van. Absolutely.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: Absolutely.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: Once you grow and you have a fleet of like six vans, the rest don't need it. But however,
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: a rap van is your van is parked on the street during the job. The van is a billboard.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Yeah. That's that's that's that that's where I see the importance. And it looks official customers when you pull up to the f****** house, you know, they see a white creeper van, they're like, "Huh?" Yeah.
 
 
00:25:25
 
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: Some some don't trip about it,
R: What?
Tyler Hamilton: but like you pull up with a nice wrapped van,
R: White
Tyler Hamilton: dude. They're like, "Oh, this these guys are f****** legit."
R: windowless van. Your company might as well be called Amber Alert.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
R: But
Tyler Hamilton: I did I think I think about all this s***, you know, and I'm like my buddy's like I'm So I quit my my job to do this
R: uh
Tyler Hamilton: full-time and he still has a full-time job and so he's not like as invested in it as I am, you know?
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: So,
R: Well,
Tyler Hamilton: but I I'm the kind of guy that's like I'm going to make these changes and then I'll ask for forgiveness later when I'm handing him a
R: um
Tyler Hamilton: f****** fat check, you know?
R: yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: So,
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: like that's how my brain works.
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: Uh but but I think
R: I've started I've started with small uh with small businesses that are really really opposed to like system overhauls and updates that uh I used to I I used to do a uh basically a mutiny technique whereas I make all of the changes isolated separately and then it just can be turned on and then it's like all right well here is everything we've done and here's the money that's coming in. I'm gonna say sorry, but there's a lot of zeros on this check,
 
 
00:26:41
 
R: so I don't really want to say
Tyler Hamilton: Okay, I'm gonna um I got his email,
R: sorry.
Tyler Hamilton: so I'm going to copy Right. And then I'll just email it to you. Is that what I
R: Uh yeah, just I sent you by an email.
Tyler Hamilton: do?
R: Um because I'm coming up. I've got a meeting here in a little bit. Um,
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: but we can uh I can kind of figure out where where we're going from here and kind of get some basic questions. But, um, yeah,
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: I think you would benefit from from SEO, from like getting like updating the website, um, getting a system in place to actually track customers and to be able to market out to
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: them. Um, and then from there,
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: kind of just build your presence. let make sure people can find you. Um, and and that's the thing with marketing.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: He does have a point with, you know, white women's fans, great, but they're established.
 
 
00:27:37
 
R: You don't have to put money into marketing and and campaigning like this stuff later once once you get a bit get business and like and branding,
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: then it can be referral, word of mouth. Um, but yeah, it's just getting you gotta be gotta be findable because lead genen is uh let me see if I can do this is
Tyler Hamilton: Heat.
R: um uh I'll I'll do this. Um I'm going to look at my the law firm I work for. Um
Tyler Hamilton: lead genen lead genen is like literally like a quarter of the battle, right? And so I think that, you know, obviously getting the word of mouth work is important, but I'm trying to kickstart this and f****** kick it into high gear, you know? I don't want to wait for these leads to call me. I want people to be calling me from multiple different sources so that way we can expand faster and start breaking in some f******
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: dough. Like the whole point of starting your own f****** company is that you f****** want the money.
 
 
00:28:39
 
Tyler Hamilton: You know what I mean? You So like in my in my mind I'm like let's f****** get this s*** going, you know?
R: Yeah. Uh,
Tyler Hamilton: So
R: so a little bit of like inside information. I I'm not going to share the the graph,
Tyler Hamilton: yeah.
R: but I'm looking at uh over the last 30 uh 30 days for the law firm that I work for. Um, they've had 497 leads. Over the last 30 days, 48 of those are Google leads.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. And that's just a stat from the law firm. What law firm is it?
R: Uh, it's called bold IP.
Tyler Hamilton: Oh, okay. What kind of What kind of What kind of
R: They do patent they do patent and trademark work.
Tyler Hamilton: Okay, cool.
R: Yeah. And IP brokering stuff.
Tyler Hamilton: Okay,
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: cool.
R: But it's it's one of those things is that's how like that's how people find services.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, they search on they f******
R: If someone needs the things I Google it.
 
 
00:29:36
 
Tyler Hamilton: look him up on Google right away.
R: Yeah. getting getting on that
Tyler Hamilton: That's what I told Kevin. I'm like that's what I just I literally just got done talking to him on the phone.
R: field.
Tyler Hamilton: I was like, "Yeah, man. We need to do a Google page." Telling you, man. He's like, "Uh, you know, you got door hangers and stuff." I'm like, "I'm I don't want to drive around putting these on doors when people could literally be looking us up. You know,
R: Yeah. Oh god.
Tyler Hamilton: people can
R: The door the door hanger is the equivalent of a booer telling you if you need a job just go like hand your resume. Walk in like walk in and ask if they're hiring so they can be weirded out.
Tyler Hamilton: Right, right, right. No,
R: It's
Tyler Hamilton: yeah, I know. People want to look it up on Google.
R: 2025.
Tyler Hamilton: I any anytime I'm looking for anything, I f****** Google search that s***, dude. And I find it hit the address.
 
 
00:30:16
 
Tyler Hamilton: It's so user friendly. And I want the Google.
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: So, this was my other question real quick before you go. Um when when we set up our Google page,
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: we don't have in a shop address. This will all be done like mobile, you know, out of like we have his house and s***,
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: but do you have to put in an address when you when you put it on when you make a Google page? Cuz I've seen companies on there that don't have addresses. It just says servicing so and so
R: Yeah,
Tyler Hamilton: areas.
R: there's plenty of ways around it and you can do a PO box. Um, a PO box is recommended uh that way be because uh so you can get mailing back if you need it. Um, but yeah, you you can absolutely do that.
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: And then um what you can do is uh once you have that once you have a Google page and exists on Google um then you can uh and Yelp I would say as well.
 
 
00:31:10
 
R: Um then you can kind of start doing things where like the hangers are hangers are great.
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: You leave leave something after every job you leave a request to do a fivestar or like not give them like a flat like 50 bucks off the your next one if you leave us a fivestar
Tyler Hamilton: Right. Or if you refer us,
R: review.
Tyler Hamilton: we'll give you like we'll give you a f****** a check or something or certain percentage off the next cleaning or something like
R: Yeah. Yeah. You always want to because your your leads can be turned one cleaning can be turned
Tyler Hamilton: that.
R: into someone that just uses your service every quarter with the right drip marketing and drip campaign and that person can then refer to other people. Your van sitting on the street is 100% for sure going to be a lot. If you drive into a neighborhood with a ton of solar panels like all over, like one of those new like one of the uh like the new fresh built uh like
Tyler Hamilton: H that's ho the HOA developments.
 
 
00:32:07
 
R: suburban Yeah. You know,
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: they they're absolute s*** buildings. They're built barely to code, just mass-produced.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Yeah.
R: But solar is a big thing. You get a f******
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: HOA with 19 19 homes in it,
Tyler Hamilton: Right.
R: you you market to the HOA because if you market to market
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, it's
R: to the HOA, if you can get a deal and strike a deal,
Tyler Hamilton: valid.
R: be like, hey, we'll give you like 25% off all services through the your HOA. It's like great. uh as the HOA we've now decided that you are required to do solar cleaning and now 19 pe 19 houses have to do have to get the service and yeah yeah there's there's definitely lots of things to
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, that's f****** that's awesome.
R: do uh and that can be done one thing uh I say is this is because I'll do some thinking and and searching and get back to you a little later today or tomorrow but uh with your partner
Tyler Hamilton: Okay. Okay.
 
 
00:33:08
 
R: ask him this is the million million dollar uh million-dollar companies that are do that just have white fans that are doing well. Just ask him to find you three examples and then watch
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: him sit down and Google because it's not about
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: finding examples which could be good examples but what it's about is is
Tyler Hamilton: Right. It's him using f******
R: is you're you're tricking him into proving your point
Tyler Hamilton: Google.
R: himself. is and when people are stubborn or like resilient to change, it's really about like showing them and relating is like, hey, you do this and they so then they stop seeing outwardly and they also see inwardly on
Tyler Hamilton: Right. No,
R: it.
Tyler Hamilton: that's a good that's a good valid point. And it's not like a f*** you, it's like a see, you know? You see what I You see what I mean?
R: Yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah. Cuz I'm like I don't know. My brain works a little bit differently. Advertising I think is super important.
 
 
00:34:08
 
Tyler Hamilton: And I think word of the mouth is also important, but like I just think about it like how I how I how I would think as a consumer. You know what I mean? Like if I need any services, I'm looking at right away on Google looking at all the reviews, like looking at that kind of s***. And that's what a lot of people in Washington are doing.
R: Yeah. And
Tyler Hamilton: Like especially Washington state being such a woke state,
R: also,
Tyler Hamilton: you know, they're all they're all like all about the reviews, all about the Google page, you know, they see the rap band. Okay, that's like from what I see like,
R: oh yeah,
Tyler Hamilton: you know what I mean? Looks
R: and oh, and that's the other thing is like updating the website with your photos on it and stuff like that.
Tyler Hamilton: professional.
R: What you do is you put a name, a little blurb, a nice nice headshot photo and your pronouns like
Tyler Hamilton: And the pronouns he
R: a a Washington state person opening up seeing a face saying he him
 
 
00:34:51
 
Tyler Hamilton: him.
R: and it's it's you've got to market to your area.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, 100%. Even though I even yeah,
R: Um,
Tyler Hamilton: aside from all the political b*******, you know, I'm not really part part of it all, but a lot of people in the Seattle area and Washington in general area would that would appeal to
R: yeah. Yeah. Hey,
Tyler Hamilton: them,
R: and I'm the I'm the same way. So, it's just like it's this is just to make people comfortable and more o receptive. Um,
Tyler Hamilton: right?
R: but uh I think I have one last question um because I want to go over and I'll kind of put together a thing and I'll have
Tyler Hamilton: Of course.
R: some more questions for you and everything.
Tyler Hamilton: Okay.
R: Um, what is
Tyler Hamilton: in in that call in that next call, I'll make sure that Kevin's involved, too, so we can we can both talk to him.
R: Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
Tyler Hamilton: He's dude, he's awesome. He's an awesome guy.
R: And Oh,
Tyler Hamilton: He's an awesome guy.
 
 
00:35:37
 
Tyler Hamilton: He's just more simplistic about this whole this whole
R: yeah. No, dude. I've I've wor I've worked with companies where it's a 75-year-old man who refuses to use anything but
Tyler Hamilton: thing.
R: paper and won't change. And it's just like, dude, you are stubborn and you're an idiot for this, but they're fun. They're cool people.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: It's just It's just Yeah. Some people are resilient to change. Some people are resilient to it because you can't visually see the work because it's behind the scenes. It's it's just code and numbers when you can't see the physical work.
Tyler Hamilton: Yeah.
R: And that's probably one of the biggest things is physicality is it's the like like the door hangers stuff like that. That's physicality. It's got that. Um but what uh what would you say is like your look your budget that you're looking to stay in?
Tyler Hamilton: Um, for what? Like a marketing campaign thing. What would you call
R: uh both both I would say uh in two forms.
Tyler Hamilton: this?
R: One a just like a monthly cost thing um you know for like if I could yeah just kind of a monthly cost on it because then that can kind of encompass like Google ad spend um mis like system you know monthly costs for certain systems stuff like that.
Tyler Hamilton: Okay. Yeah, I'd have to get back to you on that.
R: Yeah, just yeah, think on that.
Tyler Hamilton: But but yeah, I'll definitely I'll write that down and a few other things and then um we'll set up another Google Meet and we'll have
R: Um,
Tyler Hamilton: a lot I'll have a lot more information with Kevin there as well. We'd be able to actually get some get some footing um into what we're doing.
